# Warhammer-40k-datasheet-viewer

this is my current project! The idea behind this project is to ease some of the difficulties that concerning bookkeeping in the Warhammer 40k tabletop, but also a good opportunity to learn Next.js!
It's a bit of a passion project as I mix my passion for problem solving and programming with my own personal interests outside of coding!
