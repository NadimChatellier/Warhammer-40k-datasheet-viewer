Such CHARACTER units are known as Leaders, and the units they can lead – known as their Bodyguard units – are listed on their datasheet.During the Declare Battle Formations step, for each Leader in your army, if your army also includes one or more of that Leader’s Bodyguard units, you can select one of those Bodyguard units. That Leader will then attach to that Bodyguard unit for the duration of the battle and is said to be leading that unit. Each Bodyguard unit can only have one Leader attached to it.While a Bodyguard unit contains a Leader, it is known as an Attached unit and, with the exception of rules that are triggered when units are destroyed, it is treated as a single unit for all rules purposes. Each time an attack targets an Attached unit, until the attacking unit has resolved all of its attacks, you must use the Toughness characteristic of the Bodyguard models in that unit, even if a Leader in that unit has a different Toughness characteristic. Each time an attack sucessfully wounds an Attached unit, that attack cannot be allocated to a CHARACTER model in that unit, even if that CHARACTER model has lost one or more wounds or has already had attacks allocated to it this phase. As soon as the last Bodyguard model in an Attached unit has been destroyed, any attacks made against that unit that have yet to be allocated can then be allocated to CHARACTER models in that unit.Each time the last model in a Bodyguard unit is destroyed, each CHARACTER unit that is part of that Attached unit is no longer part of an Attached unit. It becomes a separate unit, with its original Starting Strength.

Each time a unit that is part of an Attached unit is destroyed, it does not have the keywords of any other units that make up that Attached unit (unless it has those keywords on its own datasheet) for the purposes of any rules that would be triggered when that unit is destroyed.Example: If you only destroy the Bodyguard unit that is part of an Attached unit, you have not destroyed a CHARACTER unit. If you only destroy the CHARACTER unit that is part of an Attached unit, or if you destroy the whole Attached unit, you have destroyed one CHARACTER unit.Before the battle, CHARACTER units with the Leader ability can be attached to one of their Bodyguard units to form an Attached unit.Attached units can only contain one Leader.Attacks cannot be allocated to CHARACTER models in Attached units.",

That Leader will then attach to that Bodyguard unit for the duration of the battle and is said to be leading that unit. Each Bodyguard unit can only have one Leader attached to it.While a Bodyguard unit contains a Leader, it is known as an Attached unit and, with the exception of rules that are triggered when units are destroyed, it is treated as a single unit for all rules purposes. Each time an attack targets an Attached unit, until the attacking unit has resolved all of its attacks, you must use the Toughness characteristic of the Bodyguard models in that unit, even if a Leader in that unit has a different Toughness characteristic. Each time an attack sucessfully wounds an Attached unit, that attack cannot be allocated to a CHARACTER model in that unit, even if that CHARACTER model has lost one or more wounds or has already had attacks allocated to it this phase. As soon as the last Bodyguard model in an Attached unit has been destroyed, any attacks made against that unit that have yet to be allocated can then be allocated to CHARACTER models in that unit.Each time the last model in a Bodyguard unit is destroyed, each CHARACTER unit that is part of that Attached unit is no longer part of an Attached unit.

Each time a unit that is part of an Attached unit is destroyed, it does not have the keywords of any other units that make up that Attached unit (unless it has those keywords on its own datasheet) for the purposes of any rules that would be triggered when that unit is destroyed.Example: If you only destroy the Bodyguard unit that is part of an Attached unit, you have not destroyed a CHARACTER unit. If you only destroy the CHARACTER unit that is part of an Attached unit, or if you destroy the whole Attached unit, you have destroyed one CHARACTER unit.Before the battle, CHARACTER units with the Leader ability can be attached to one of their Bodyguard units to form an Attached unit.Attached units can only contain one Leader.Attacks cannot be allocated to CHARACTER models in Attached units.",

Keep your Miracle dice to one side - this is your Miracle dice pool.PERFORMING AN ACT OF FAITHBefore making a dice roll for a model or unit from your army with the Acts of Faith ability, if you have one or more dice in your Miracle dice pool, that unit can perform an Act of Faith. If it does, select one of the dice from your Miracle dice pool to substitute that dice roll (if a roll involves more than one dice, e.g. a Charge roll or Battle-shock test, only a single dice can be substituted). The dice that is being substituted is not rolled; instead, the value of the selected Miracle dice is used as if it had been rolled ( this counts as an unmodified dice roll of that value for all rules purposes). Each Miracle dice can only be selected for substitution once. Once all Miracle dice substitutions have been made, remove the chosen Miracle dice from your Miracle dice pool, and roll all remaining, unsubstituted dice that are a part of the dice roll. You can use Miracle dice when a unit performs an Act of Faith for any of the following types of dice roll:Advance rollBattle-shock testCharge rollDamage rollHit rollSaving throwWound rollExample: Instead of rolling 2D6 to take a unit’s Battle-shock test, you could use one dice from your Miracle dice pool.

Each time a unit that is part of an Attached unit is destroyed, it does not have the keywords of any other units that make up that Attached unit (unless it has those keywords on its own datasheet) for the purposes of any rules that would be triggered when that unit is destroyed.Example: If you only destroy the Bodyguard unit that is part of an Attached unit, you have not destroyed a CHARACTER unit. If you only destroy the CHARACTER unit that is part of an Attached unit, or if you destroy the whole Attached unit, you have destroyed one CHARACTER unit.Before the battle, CHARACTER units with the Leader ability can be attached to one of their Bodyguard units to form an Attached unit.Attached units can only contain one Leader.Attacks cannot be allocated to CHARACTER models in Attached units.",

If it does, select one of the dice from your Miracle dice pool to substitute that dice roll (if a roll involves more than one dice, e.g. a Charge roll or Battle-shock test, only a single dice can be substituted). The dice that is being substituted is not rolled; instead, the value of the selected Miracle dice is used as if it had been rolled ( this counts as an unmodified dice roll of that value for all rules purposes). Each Miracle dice can only be selected for substitution once. Once all Miracle dice substitutions have been made, remove the chosen Miracle dice from your Miracle dice pool, and roll all remaining, unsubstituted dice that are a part of the dice roll. You can use Miracle dice when a unit performs an Act of Faith for any of the following types of dice roll:Advance rollBattle-shock testCharge rollDamage rollHit rollSaving throwWound rollExample: Instead of rolling 2D6 to take a unit’s Battle-shock test, you could use one dice from your Miracle dice pool.

If this happens as the result of an attack, they become separate units after the attacking unit has resolved all of its attacks.Each time the last model in a CHARACTER unit that is attached to a Bodyguard unit is destroyed and there is not another CHARACTER unit attached, that Attached unit’s Bodyguard unit is no longer part of an Attached unit. It becomes a separate unit, with its original Starting Strength. If this happens as the result of an attack, they become separate units after the attacking unit has resolved all of its attacks. Each time a unit that is part of an Attached unit is destroyed, it does not have the keywords of any other units that make up that Attached unit (unless it has those keywords on its own datasheet) for the purposes of any rules that would be triggered when that unit is destroyed.Example: If you only destroy the Bodyguard unit that is part of an Attached unit, you have not destroyed a CHARACTER unit. If you only destroy the CHARACTER unit that is part of an Attached unit, or if you destroy the whole Attached unit, you have destroyed one CHARACTER unit.Before the battle, CHARACTER units with the Leader ability can be attached to one of their Bodyguard units to form an Attached unit.Attached units can only contain one Leader.Attacks cannot be allocated to CHARACTER models in Attached units.",

The number you roll is the value of that Miracle dice. This value cannot be changed or re-rolled, unless a rule specifically states otherwise. Keep your Miracle dice to one side - this is your Miracle dice pool.PERFORMING AN ACT OF FAITHBefore making a dice roll for a model or unit from your army with the Acts of Faith ability, if you have one or more dice in your Miracle dice pool, that unit can perform an Act of Faith. If it does, select one of the dice from your Miracle dice pool to substitute that dice roll (if a roll involves more than one dice, e.g. a Charge roll or Battle-shock test, only a single dice can be substituted). The dice that is being substituted is not rolled; instead, the value of the selected Miracle dice is used as if it had been rolled ( this counts as an unmodified dice roll of that value for all rules purposes). Each Miracle dice can only be selected for substitution once. Once all Miracle dice substitutions have been made, remove the chosen Miracle dice from your Miracle dice pool, and roll all remaining, unsubstituted dice that are a part of the dice roll. You can use Miracle dice when a unit performs an Act of Faith for any of the following types of dice roll:Advance rollBattle-shock testCharge rollDamage rollHit rollSaving throwWound rollExample: Instead of rolling 2D6 to take a unit’s Battle-shock test, you could use one dice from your Miracle dice pool. If the value of that dice was 4, the unit’s Battle-shock test would be determined by rolling one D6 and adding 4 to it (i.e. it would be D6+4).",

The number you roll is the value of that Miracle dice. This value cannot be changed or re-rolled, unless a rule specifically states otherwise. Keep your Miracle dice to one side - this is your Miracle dice pool.PERFORMING AN ACT OF FAITHBefore making a dice roll for a model or unit from your army with the Acts of Faith ability, if you have one or more dice in your Miracle dice pool, that unit can perform an Act of Faith. If it does, select one of the dice from your Miracle dice pool to substitute that dice roll (if a roll involves more than one dice, e.g. a Charge roll or Battle-shock test, only a single dice can be substituted). The dice that is being substituted is not rolled; instead, the value of the selected Miracle dice is used as if it had been rolled ( this counts as an unmodified dice roll of that value for all rules purposes). Each Miracle dice can only be selected for substitution once. Once all Miracle dice substitutions have been made, remove the chosen Miracle dice from your Miracle dice pool, and roll all remaining, unsubstituted dice that are a part of the dice roll. You can use Miracle dice when a unit performs an Act of Faith for any of the following types of dice roll:Advance rollBattle-shock testCharge rollDamage rollHit rollSaving throwWound rollExample: Instead of rolling 2D6 to take a unit’s Battle-shock test, you could use one dice from your Miracle dice pool. If the value of that dice was 4, the unit’s Battle-shock test would be determined by rolling one D6 and adding 4 to it (i.e. it would be D6+4).",

If you are splitting a unit that has the Cherub ability, only one of the new units can use that ability during the battle – make a note of which of the new units this will be). One of these units must start the battle embarked within this TRANSPORT; the other can start the battle embarked within another TRANSPORT, or it can be deployed as a separate unit.|false|||||https://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/factions/adepta-sororitas/Immolator|",

Such CHARACTER units are known as Leaders, and the units they can lead – known as their Bodyguard units – are listed on their datasheet.During the Declare Battle Formations step, for each Leader in your army, if your army also includes one or more of that Leader’s Bodyguard units, you can select one of those Bodyguard units. That Leader will then attach to that Bodyguard unit for the duration of the battle and is said to be leading that unit. Each Bodyguard unit can only have one Leader attached to it.While a Bodyguard unit contains a Leader, it is known as an Attached unit and, with the exception of rules that are triggered when units are destroyed, it is treated as a single unit for all rules purposes. Each time an attack targets an Attached unit, until the attacking unit has resolved all of its attacks, you must use the Toughness characteristic of the Bodyguard models in that unit, even if a Leader in that unit has a different Toughness characteristic. Each time an attack sucessfully wounds an Attached unit, that attack cannot be allocated to a CHARACTER model in that unit, even if that CHARACTER model has lost one or more wounds or has already had attacks allocated to it this phase. As soon as the last Bodyguard model in an Attached unit has been destroyed, any attacks made against that unit that have yet to be allocated can then be allocated to CHARACTER models in that unit.Each time the last model in a Bodyguard unit is destroyed, each CHARACTER unit that is part of that Attached unit is no longer part of an Attached unit. It becomes a separate unit, with its original Starting Strength. If this happens as the result of an attack, they become separate units after the attacking unit has resolved all of its attacks.Each time the last model in a CHARACTER unit that is attached to a Bodyguard unit is destroyed and there is not another CHARACTER unit attached, that Attached unit’s Bodyguard unit is no longer part of an Attached unit.

Each time a unit that is part of an Attached unit is destroyed, it does not have the keywords of any other units that make up that Attached unit (unless it has those keywords on its own datasheet) for the purposes of any rules that would be triggered when that unit is destroyed.Example: If you only destroy the Bodyguard unit that is part of an Attached unit, you have not destroyed a CHARACTER unit. If you only destroy the CHARACTER unit that is part of an Attached unit, or if you destroy the whole Attached unit, you have destroyed one CHARACTER unit.Before the battle, CHARACTER units with the Leader ability can be attached to one of their Bodyguard units to form an Attached unit.Attached units can only contain one Leader.Attacks cannot be allocated to CHARACTER models in Attached units.",

Such CHARACTER units are known as Leaders, and the units they can lead – known as their Bodyguard units – are listed on their datasheet.During the Declare Battle Formations step, for each Leader in your army, if your army also includes one or more of that Leader’s Bodyguard units, you can select one of those Bodyguard units. That Leader will then attach to that Bodyguard unit for the duration of the battle and is said to be leading that unit. Each Bodyguard unit can only have one Leader attached to it.While a Bodyguard unit contains a Leader, it is known as an Attached unit and, with the exception of rules that are triggered when units are destroyed, it is treated as a single unit for all rules purposes. Each time an attack targets an Attached unit, until the attacking unit has resolved all of its attacks, you must use the Toughness characteristic of the Bodyguard models in that unit, even if a Leader in that unit has a different Toughness characteristic. Each time an attack sucessfully wounds an Attached unit, that attack cannot be allocated to a CHARACTER model in that unit, even if that CHARACTER model has lost one or more wounds or has already had attacks allocated to it this phase. As soon as the last Bodyguard model in an Attached unit has been destroyed, any attacks made against that unit that have yet to be allocated can then be allocated to CHARACTER models in that unit.Each time the last model in a Bodyguard unit is destroyed, each CHARACTER unit that is part of that Attached unit is no longer part of an Attached unit.

Each time a unit that is part of an Attached unit is destroyed, it does not have the keywords of any other units that make up that Attached unit (unless it has those keywords on its own datasheet) for the purposes of any rules that would be triggered when that unit is destroyed.Example: If you only destroy the Bodyguard unit that is part of an Attached unit, you have not destroyed a CHARACTER unit. If you only destroy the CHARACTER unit that is part of an Attached unit, or if you destroy the whole Attached unit, you have destroyed one CHARACTER unit.Before the battle, CHARACTER units with the Leader ability can be attached to one of their Bodyguard units to form an Attached unit.Attached units can only contain one Leader.Attacks cannot be allocated to CHARACTER models in Attached units.",

If it does, select one of the dice from your Miracle dice pool to substitute that dice roll (if a roll involves more than one dice, e.g. a Charge roll or Battle-shock test, only a single dice can be substituted). The dice that is being substituted is not rolled; instead, the value of the selected Miracle dice is used as if it had been rolled ( this counts as an unmodified dice roll of that value for all rules purposes). Each Miracle dice can only be selected for substitution once. Once all Miracle dice substitutions have been made, remove the chosen Miracle dice from your Miracle dice pool, and roll all remaining, unsubstituted dice that are a part of the dice roll.

Such CHARACTER units are known as Leaders, and the units they can lead – known as their Bodyguard units – are listed on their datasheet.During the Declare Battle Formations step, for each Leader in your army, if your army also includes one or more of that Leader’s Bodyguard units, you can select one of those Bodyguard units. That Leader will then attach to that Bodyguard unit for the duration of the battle and is said to be leading that unit. Each Bodyguard unit can only have one Leader attached to it.While a Bodyguard unit contains a Leader, it is known as an Attached unit and, with the exception of rules that are triggered when units are destroyed, it is treated as a single unit for all rules purposes. Each time an attack targets an Attached unit, until the attacking unit has resolved all of its attacks, you must use the Toughness characteristic of the Bodyguard models in that unit, even if a Leader in that unit has a different Toughness characteristic. Each time an attack sucessfully wounds an Attached unit, that attack cannot be allocated to a CHARACTER model in that unit, even if that CHARACTER model has lost one or more wounds or has already had attacks allocated to it this phase. As soon as the last Bodyguard model in an Attached unit has been destroyed, any attacks made against that unit that have yet to be allocated can then be allocated to CHARACTER models in that unit.Each time the last model in a Bodyguard unit is destroyed, each CHARACTER unit that is part of that Attached unit is no longer part of an Attached unit. It becomes a separate unit, with its original Starting Strength. If this happens as the result of an attack, they become separate units after the attacking unit has resolved all of its attacks.Each time the last model in a CHARACTER unit that is attached to a Bodyguard unit is destroyed and there is not another CHARACTER unit attached, that Attached unit’s Bodyguard unit is no longer part of an Attached unit. It becomes a separate unit, with its original Starting Strength. If this happens as the result of an attack, they become separate units after the attacking unit has resolved all of its attacks. Each time a unit that is part of an Attached unit is destroyed, it does not have the keywords of any other units that make up that Attached unit (unless it has those keywords on its own datasheet) for the purposes of any rules that would be triggered when that unit is destroyed.Example: If you only destroy the Bodyguard unit that is part of an Attached unit, you have not destroyed a CHARACTER unit. If you only destroy the CHARACTER unit that is part of an Attached unit, or if you destroy the whole Attached unit, you have destroyed one CHARACTER unit.Before the battle, CHARACTER units with the Leader ability can be attached to one of their Bodyguard units to form an Attached unit.Attached units can only contain one Leader.Attacks cannot be allocated to CHARACTER models in Attached units.",

Keep your Miracle dice to one side - this is your Miracle dice pool.PERFORMING AN ACT OF FAITHBefore making a dice roll for a model or unit from your army with the Acts of Faith ability, if you have one or more dice in your Miracle dice pool, that unit can perform an Act of Faith. If it does, select one of the dice from your Miracle dice pool to substitute that dice roll (if a roll involves more than one dice, e.g. a Charge roll or Battle-shock test, only a single dice can be substituted). The dice that is being substituted is not rolled; instead, the value of the selected Miracle dice is used as if it had been rolled ( this counts as an unmodified dice roll of that value for all rules purposes). Each Miracle dice can only be selected for substitution once. Once all Miracle dice substitutions have been made, remove the chosen Miracle dice from your Miracle dice pool, and roll all remaining, unsubstituted dice that are a part of the dice roll. You can use Miracle dice when a unit performs an Act of Faith for any of the following types of dice roll:Advance rollBattle-shock testCharge rollDamage rollHit rollSaving throwWound rollExample: Instead of rolling 2D6 to take a unit’s Battle-shock test, you could use one dice from your Miracle dice pool.

Such CHARACTER units are known as Leaders, and the units they can lead – known as their Bodyguard units – are listed on their datasheet.During the Declare Battle Formations step, for each Leader in your army, if your army also includes one or more of that Leader’s Bodyguard units, you can select one of those Bodyguard units. That Leader will then attach to that Bodyguard unit for the duration of the battle and is said to be leading that unit. Each Bodyguard unit can only have one Leader attached to it.While a Bodyguard unit contains a Leader, it is known as an Attached unit and, with the exception of rules that are triggered when units are destroyed, it is treated as a single unit for all rules purposes. Each time an attack targets an Attached unit, until the attacking unit has resolved all of its attacks, you must use the Toughness characteristic of the Bodyguard models in that unit, even if a Leader in that unit has a different Toughness characteristic. Each time an attack sucessfully wounds an Attached unit, that attack cannot be allocated to a CHARACTER model in that unit, even if that CHARACTER model has lost one or more wounds or has already had attacks allocated to it this phase. As soon as the last Bodyguard model in an Attached unit has been destroyed, any attacks made against that unit that have yet to be allocated can then be allocated to CHARACTER models in that unit.Each time the last model in a Bodyguard unit is destroyed, each CHARACTER unit that is part of that Attached unit is no longer part of an Attached unit. It becomes a separate unit, with its original Starting Strength. If this happens as the result of an attack, they become separate units after the attacking unit has resolved all of its attacks.Each time the last model in a CHARACTER unit that is attached to a Bodyguard unit is destroyed and there is not another CHARACTER unit attached, that Attached unit’s Bodyguard unit is no longer part of an Attached unit.

Each time a unit that is part of an Attached unit is destroyed, it does not have the keywords of any other units that make up that Attached unit (unless it has those keywords on its own datasheet) for the purposes of any rules that would be triggered when that unit is destroyed.Example: If you only destroy the Bodyguard unit that is part of an Attached unit, you have not destroyed a CHARACTER unit. If you only destroy the CHARACTER unit that is part of an Attached unit, or if you destroy the whole Attached unit, you have destroyed one CHARACTER unit.Before the battle, CHARACTER units with the Leader ability can be attached to one of their Bodyguard units to form an Attached unit.Attached units can only contain one Leader.Attacks cannot be allocated to CHARACTER models in Attached units.",

            "description": "If your Army Faction is ADEPTA SORORITAS, each unit from your army with this ability can perform one Act of Faith per phase. This is done using Miracle dice.GAINING MIRACLE DICEIf your Army Faction is ADEPTA SORORITAS, you gain 1 Miracle dice:At the start of each battle round.At the end of each phase, If one or more ADEPTA SORORITAS units from your army were destroyed that phase.Each time you gain a Miracle dice, roll one D6. The number you roll is the value of that Miracle dice. This value cannot be changed or re-rolled, unless a rule specifically states otherwise. Keep your Miracle dice to one side - this is your Miracle dice pool.PERFORMING AN ACT OF FAITHBefore making a dice roll for a model or unit from your army with the Acts of Faith ability, if you have one or more dice in your Miracle dice pool, that unit can perform an Act of Faith. If it does, select one of the dice from your Miracle dice pool to substitute that dice roll (if a roll involves more than one dice, e.g. a Charge roll or Battle-shock test, only a single dice can be substituted). The dice that is being substituted is not rolled; instead, the value of the selected Miracle dice is used as if it had been rolled ( this counts as an unmodified dice roll of that value for all rules purposes). Each Miracle dice can only be selected for substitution once. Once all Miracle dice substitutions have been made, remove the chosen Miracle dice from your Miracle dice pool, and roll all remaining, unsubstituted dice that are a part of the dice roll. You can use Miracle dice when a unit performs an Act of Faith for any of the following types of dice roll:Advance rollBattle-shock testCharge rollDamage rollHit rollSaving throwWound rollExample: Instead of rolling 2D6 to take a unit’s Battle-shock test, you could use one dice from your Miracle dice pool. If the value of that dice was 4, the unit’s Battle-shock test would be determined by rolling one D6 and adding 4 to it (i.e. it would be D6+4).",
